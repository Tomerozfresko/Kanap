This is the front end and back end server for the 5th project of the Web Developer path.

### Prerequisites ###
"Live Server" VS extension,
Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

### Back end ###

Clone this repo. From the "back" folder of the project, run `npm install`. You 
can then run the server with `node server`. 
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.

### Front end ###

From the "front" folder of the project, open using the "Live server" extension the file "front/html/index.html".
